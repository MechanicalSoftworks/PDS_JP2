PDS_JP2 Release Notes


* Release 3.17

The PDS_to_JP2 application and the JP2_Encoder class that it uses have been
enhanced with lossy bit rate and quality layers controls.


* Release 3.16

The JP2_to_PDS application and the Converters used to manage the PDS file
label generation have been changed to correc the handling of the -resolution
option.


* Release 3.15.2

The Kakadu libraries have been upgraded to version 6.1.

A Kakadu_Build kit has been added to the distribution for use in
building the Kakadu libraries in a manner consistent with PDS_JP2 naming
expectations.


* Release 3.15.1

An exception while searching for a label converter will be reported.

A data dependent bug in the idaeim PVL library was corrected.


* Release 3.15

Added a -No_output command line option to the applications that will
completely initialize the worker classes and generate all report
listings but produce no output file(s). This is particularly useful to
check an operation before committing to file creation, or for a quick
way to see the structure of the files involved.

Fixed a bug that resulted in the wrong image size values in the PDS
label when JP2_to_PDS was used to render the image at less than full
resolution.

Enhanced the Generic_PDS_Converter to correctly process HiRISE EDR
files.
