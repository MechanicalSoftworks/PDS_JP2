Kakadu Build Notes

* 6.4.3

Revised to use a common Build/Makefile.conf that configures common settings for
all Makefiles.

Enhanced to provide FAT_MAC builds on Darwin OS.

* 6.4

The contrib subdirectory is no longer in use.

* 6.3

Added a Make-SunOS-i86pc Build configuration.

* 6.2

There have been significant changes to the source code structure. As a result
the v6.1 Build system is not compatibile with the 6.2 Kakadu distribution.

A Linux build may produce numerous warnings about unused return values from
the fread and fgets system calls. While the source code changes to prevent
these warnings are trivial, they are not necessary: the warnings can be
safely ignored.
